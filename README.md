# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Lab Experiments

This repository contains 10 core Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) experiments performed as part of the 3rd-year AIDS curriculum. The goal is to provide a structured and beginner-friendly reference for students looking to understand and implement foundational ANN concepts using Python and relevant libraries.

## About the Repository

Each experiment folder contains:
- Source code (with comments)
- Sample output screenshots (if available)
- Brief explanations and instructions to run the code

The experiments cover a variety of ANN topics including perceptrons, backpropagation, activation functions, and practical model training using datasets.
