# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Lab Experiments

This repository contains 10 core Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) experiments performed as part of the 3rd-year AIDS curriculum. The goal is to provide a structured and beginner-friendly reference for students looking to understand and implement foundational ANN concepts using Python and relevant libraries.

## About the Repository

Each experiment folder contains:
- Source code (with comments)
- Sample output screenshots (if available)
- Brief explanations and instructions to run the code

The experiments cover a variety of ANN topics including perceptrons, backpropagation, activation functions, and practical model training using datasets.

## List of Experiments

1. **Perceptron Algorithm Implementation**
2. **Backpropagation Algorithm**
3. **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Model**
4. **AND, OR, XOR Gate using Neural Networks**
5. **Activation Functions (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU)**
6. **Gradient Descent Implementation**
7. **Feedforward Neural Network**
8. **ANN for Classification (Iris Dataset)**
9. **ANN for Regression (Custom Dataset)**
10. **MNIST Digit Recognition using ANN**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshint0407/ANN-Lab-Experiments.git

2. Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not, install it using:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash

jupyter notebook
```

4. Navigate to the experiment folder and open the .ipynb file of your choice.

Ensure required libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras are installed in your environment.

## Target Audience
- 3rd Year AIDS Students

- Beginners in Neural Networks

- Anyone exploring foundational AI/ML concepts
